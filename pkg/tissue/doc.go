	The kin server maintains a “neighborhood” of peer kin servers.

	It reports peers that are discovered to be dead to the users.

	Kin hooks FolkAvatars with a trigger that catches Call panics

	Use lazy random walk (for sampling nodes) to avoid parity issues.

	On Join reciprocate directly by adding the caller as a kin.

	Who is responsible for discovering dying neihbors and reporting to the tube?

		The FolkAvatars (of remote peers), that kin passes to its folk services,
		are rigged with a trigger that catches panics on Call and reports to the kin server.

		The Kin server reports discovered dead peers on its internal channel to Locus.

		Locus listens for RIP discoveries and writes them to the tube system.
