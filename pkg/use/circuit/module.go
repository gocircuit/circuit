// Operators

// RegisterValue registers the type of v with the circuit runtime type system.
// As a result this program becomes able to send and receive cross-interfaces pointing to objects of this type.
// By convention, RegisterValue should be invoked from a dedicated init
// function within of the package that defines the type of v.
func RegisterValue(v interface{}) {
	types.RegisterValue(v)
}

// RegisterFunc registers the worker function type fn with the circuit runtime type system.
// fn must be of a not-necessarily public type having a single public method.
// As a result, this program is able to spawn fn on remote hosts, as well as to host
// remote invocations of fn.
// By convention, RegisterFunc should be invoked from a dedicated init
// function within of the package that defines the type of fn.

// The worker is registered under all directories in the anchor file system named by anchor.
// The worker function fn, whose type must have previously been registered with RegisterFunc,
// is executed on the newly spawned worker with arguments given by in.
// Spawn blocks until the execution of fn completes.
// Spawn returns the return values of fn's invokation in the slice retrn.
// The types of the elements of retrn exactly match the declared return types of fn's singleton public method.
// Spawn also returns the address of the spawned worker in addr.
// The new worker will be killed as soon as fn completes, unless an extension of its life is
// explicitly requested during the execution of fn via a call to RunInBack.
// Spawn does not panic. It returns any error conditions in err, in which case retrn and addr are undefined.
